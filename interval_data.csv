Season 3 Episode 7: Impact Measurement On Amazon And Other Musings On Growth,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGmP6LajCjk,"Impact is everything. Sam Hager, Co-Founder of MixShift, joins us on this Episode of The Longer Game to get into the philosophy of Amazon success, where impact measurement matters. Sam's agency experience gives him insight into what is plaguing a brand and how agencies should address these problems. You see a change in revenue. What drove that change? How big was the impact? Understanding that also requires a brand to know their why. All brands want to grow but the why behind that growth will vastly change the strategy. Once you know your why, you can better understand how much the impact of actions affect your outcome. And are you okay with that? Listen in and get ready for a bunch of questions about Amazon and some exciting answers.

The Longer Game is a podcast focused on leaning into the trends and advancements in retail so brands see a clearer path to success across ALL channels. We‚Äôre looking at retail in a whole new way, looking to better understand the future of retail. It‚Äôs Retail Reimagined. Sharing hope about the future. No one channel can a business sustain. Go omni-channel.
